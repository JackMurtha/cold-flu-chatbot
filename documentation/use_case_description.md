## Use Case: Cold / Flu Symptom Self-Assessment

**User Group:**
General public in Halifax, Nova Scotia, particularly adults experiencing mild to moderate cold or flu-like symptoms during winter months.

**Problem / Pain Points:**

- Difficulty distinguishing between symptoms of the common cold and influenza.
- Uncertainty about whether or not to seek medical care.
- Lack of awareness of evidence-based self-care guidelines.
- Risk of misinformation from online sources or social media.
- Overcrowding of healthcare services due to non-urgent visits.

**Chatbot Success Criteria:**

- Provide clear, evidence-based guidance to help users distinguish cold vs. flu symptoms.
- Direct users to official sources (Nova Scotia Health, PHAC) for home care and symptom management.
- Offer specific indicators for when to seek medical attention.
- Clearly communicate boundaries: no diagnostics or prescriptions.
- Answer the following key questions:
    - "I have a fever of 38.5 °C and a runny nose—is this the flu or just a cold?"
    - "If it's just a cold, how many days should I stay home and rest?"

**Design Constraints and Ethical Requirements:**

- Must include disclaimer: “This tool does not provide medical diagnoses.”
- Must be crisis-aware: if user indicates severe symptoms (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath), refer to emergency care.
- No storage or collection of personal health data.
- Must use official, local Canadian sources for all health information.

**Scenario Value:**

A chatbot designed for this use case can reduce misinformation, improve health literacy, and alleviate strain on local healthcare resources. Healthcare resource strain experienced during winter flu season or other events benefit from a tool such as this.
