Q:
I have a fever of 38.5 °C and a runny nose—is this the flu or just a cold?

A:
Hello! I’m here to help you understand the differences between a cold and the flu. Based on what you’ve shared, a fever of 38.5°C and a runny nose could be symptoms of either a cold or the flu.

Colds often come with a runny or stuffy nose, and the fever is usually mild, often not exceeding 38.9°C (102°F). Flu symptoms, on the other hand, tend to appear suddenly and are more intense, often including a higher fever, body aches, and fatigue.

Since your fever is below 38.9°C and you have a runny nose, it might be more consistent with a cold. However, if you start experiencing more severe symptoms like a high fever, chills, or muscle aches, it could be the flu.

Remember, I’m not a medical professional and this is not a diagnosis. If your symptoms worsen or you have concerns, it’s a good idea to contact a healthcare provider or call 811 to speak with a registered nurse. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 or visit the nearest emergency department. Take care!

Q:
If it’s just a cold, how many days should I stay home and rest?

A:
If you’re dealing with a cold, it’s generally a good idea to stay home and rest until your symptoms start to improve. Cold symptoms can last anywhere from 2 to 14 days, but most people start feeling better within a week.

During this time, rest is important to help your body fight off the virus. Staying home also helps prevent spreading the virus to others. Make sure to drink plenty of fluids, eat nutritious foods, and get enough sleep to support your recovery.

If your symptoms persist beyond 10 days or worsen, it might be a good idea to reach out to a healthcare provider for further advice. Remember, I’m not a medical professional and this is not a diagnosis. If you have any concerns or questions, you can always call 811 to speak with a registered nurse. Take care and get well soon!
